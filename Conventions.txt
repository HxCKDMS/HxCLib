Github Repo Structure
  ([name] < means folder)
  
  [libs] (if any)
  [src] (if contains code changes)
  setup/build batch files (if needed)
  .gitignore (always)
  LICENSE (always)(preferably MIT ATM, may change, if you created repo of own volition you may pick the License)

Must have this structure minimum nothing less unless valid reasoning.

Coding Style Preferences
  int a, b, c;
  String d = "bob says hi",
         e = "john is dead";
  public....() {
    code...;
  }
  
  NOT
  
  int a;
  int b;
  int c;
  String d = "bob says hi";
  String e = "john is dead";
  public....()
  {
    code...;
  }
  
I highly prefer the top style over the above style, and will adamantly change it to my liking.

if code is longer than width of screen break to next line on the following character sets
    (, || && &| &!) NOT (== <= > !=)
